# 📘 Day 5 – Limitations, Ethics & Best Practices in Prompt Engineering

## ⚠️ Understanding the Limitations of AI

Even powerful tools like ChatGPT have limitations. Today we learned that:

- AI can **hallucinate** (make up false information)
- It has **no real understanding** — it predicts text based on patterns
- AI models can be **biased** (based on training data)
- AI doesn't know real-time events (unless connected to the web)

## 🔐 Ethical Use of Prompt Engineering

Using AI responsibly is critical. Some important ethics topics include:

- ✅ **Transparency** – Let users know they’re interacting with AI
- 🙅 **No plagiarism** – Don’t pass off AI content as your own
- 💬 **Respect privacy** – Don’t ask AI to generate or expose personal data
- 🌍 **Bias awareness** – Always check AI answers for fairness and neutrality

## 🌟 Best Practices for Effective Prompts

Here are tips for writing great prompts:

1. Be **clear** and **specific**
2. Add **context** to guide the AI
3. Use **roles** ("You are a...")
4. Set the **format** you want in the response
5. Break complex tasks into **steps**
6. Use **few-shot examples** when needed
